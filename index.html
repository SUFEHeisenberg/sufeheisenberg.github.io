                RoBERTa and FinGPT and other large language models, explore a variety of deep learning training methods such as language model
                inference, fine-tuning and upstream pre-training + downstream fine-tuning. Moreover, the sentiment analysis and inference of
                different Prompts in LLMs are compared and analyzed. The Ensemble factor is predicted by using the above models;
                Based on the research results of SOTA in academia and industry, the NLP feature factors based on behavioral finance
                are established. Combined with the above factor signals, we built Pipeline framework for market investment sentiment mining.

                HC3 (Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus). We conducted Turing tests, textual statistics, sentiment analysis,
                and linguistic analysis on the corpus. We summarized the textual paradigms of ChatGPT and its differences from human
                responses, and developed a series of ChatGPT content classification detectors based on single texts and Q&A pairs
